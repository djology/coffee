Javadoc

    The javadoc tool is a program that reads a collection of source files into an internal form

        The structure isï¼š(source-files) -> [javadoc-tool:doclet]  -> (generated files)

    The Javadoc doclet is like a pluggable back end that analyzes this internal form with some goal in mind

    To use the javadoc tool, you must:

            Write source code, containing documentation comments. Documentation comments are formatted in
            HTML and are interspersed with the javadoc tool.

            Run the javadoc tool. You need to specify a doclet to analyze the documentation comments and any
            other special tags. However, if you don't specify any doclet, by default, the Standard Doclet is included.
            You specify a number of command-line options, some of which are directed at the javadoc tool itself,
            and some of which are specific to the selected doclet. The command-line help shows and distinguishes
            the options for the tool that apply to the currently selected doclet. When the standard doclet is used,
            the output generated by the standard doclet consists of a series of HTML pages. If you specify a different
            doclet, then the operation of that doclet and what files (if any) are generated may or may not be equivalent
            to the standard doclet described in this guide.
